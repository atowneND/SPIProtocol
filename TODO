- [ ] send ADC data via UART
- [ ] flash memory - Page Program
    - [ ] erase SPI
    - [ ] validate addressing
    - [ ] page program
        - [ ] test code in pageProgram function
    - [ ] dual page program
    - [ ] read/write protocol
- [ ] timer interrupt
- [ ] validate USB


PROTOCOL
0. start recording - initialize ADC and dual page program
1. timer interrupt
2. get data (ADC)
3. send byte to SPI - can there be a time lag between bytes?


refactor SPI to be interrupt-driven
timer counter doesn't change speed


record
->init timer
->init ADC
->init SPI
    ->check length and determine number of pages
    ->init counter
timer
->ADC sample
->ADC conv
->send byte to SPI
counter
->256
    ->re-init SPI with new page address
->EOF
    ->close counter
    ->close ADC
    ->close SPI
EOF (counter)
->update page table
->send data to computer
USB
->read SPI to buffer
->send buffer to USB
->repeat until EOF
EOF (usb)
->repeat from USB forward for second track?
->erase SPI
