- [x] convert int to char
- [ ] use UART6, not canned functions
- [ ] get data from ADC
    - [ ] truncate data
    - [ ] convert to char
    - [ ] send via UART
- [ ] flash memory
    - [ ] initialize SPI flash properly - why does erasing the whole chip set
      the status register to all ones?
    - [ ] explore byte-write vs AAI
- [ ] connect flash memory to ADC
    - [ ] FIFO data structure for writing to SPI
    - [ ] calculate timing of write and confirm we will have enough time
      between samples to write two bytes


- [ ] drive clock low for commanding SPI, set back to high when done
- [ ] check byte length of input
- [ ] check SPI_TRIS 1/0 setting
